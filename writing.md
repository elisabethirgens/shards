# Cut Out Friends for Unbuilt Architecture

Back in 2011, an architecture student in Sweden wanted to populate a project with humans. He photographed his friends, cut away the background, and published the collection as
[Skalgubbar](https://skalgubbar.se/). Teodor Javanaud Emdén generously offered a free license for other architects in need of his cut out friends for their visualisations. Which turned out to be an awful lot of them, from all over the world. Of the 370 photos, number 174 is particularly famous. The woman with a red bag has wandered through hundreds of scenes with unbuilt architecture. We can see some of her adventures on [@littleredridingbag](https://www.instagram.com/littleredridingbag/). The National Museum had an exhibition [Hand and Machine](https://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/exhibitions-and-events/national-museum/exhibitions/2023/hand-and-machine--architectural-drawings/) about architectural drawing — which is where I came across this fantastic internet story. Not on the web, but in an art museum!
