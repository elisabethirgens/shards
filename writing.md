# Jordan Casteel on the High Line

“I am not interested in competing with anyone. I hope we all make it.” From a mural in New York City and the artist [Jordan Casteel](https://www.jordancasteel.com/about). Her portrait of two Harlem street vendors was commisioned by The High Line, a wondrous park perched on old railway tracks, soaring above the streets. [The Baayfalls](https://www.thehighline.org/art/projects/jordan-casteel/) are Fallou Wadje and her brother, I learnt the title refers to their branch of [Sufi Muslim order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouride#Baye_Fall) from Senegal. Jordan painted Fallou years later in front of the store where Fallou then sold her fashion line. And that piece was purchased by [the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys](https://www.jordancasteel.com/exhibitions/giantsbkmuseum) — right now exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum. The mural that caught my attention when walking by in 2022 is not on display anymore, but the original painting is owned by MoMA.

# Cut Out Friends for Unbuilt Architecture

Back in 2011, an architecture student in Sweden wanted to populate a project with humans. He photographed his friends, cut away the background, and published the collection as
[Skalgubbar](https://skalgubbar.se/). Teodor Javanaud Emdén generously offered a free license for other architects in need of his cut out friends for their visualisations. Which turned out to be an awful lot of them, from all over the world. Of the 370 photos, number 174 is particularly famous. The woman with a red bag has wandered through hundreds of scenes with unbuilt architecture. We can see some of her adventures on [@littleredridingbag](https://www.instagram.com/littleredridingbag/). The National Museum had an exhibition [Hand and Machine](https://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/exhibitions-and-events/national-museum/exhibitions/2023/hand-and-machine--architectural-drawings/) about architectural drawing — which is where I came across this fantastic internet story. Not on the web, but in an art museum!
